Advent of Code 2018
===================

**Spoiler Warning:** If you want to solve the challenges by yourself, don't read the code.

This directory contains the code I used to solve the challenges from [Advent of Code 2018](http://adventofcode.com/2018).

The following table lists the available solutions by day and language. I also
added a short summary for each day. I marked the solutions which I consider
especially valuable or pretty with a star (☆).

Day | Haskell   | Description                             
----|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------
01  | [x][hs01] | [Being clever with modulus or just summing][aoc01]
02  | [x][hs02] | [Diffing and counting][aoc02]
03  | [x][hs03] | [Fabric claim rectangle overlaps][aoc03]
04  | [x][hs04] | [Sleep pattern aggregations][aoc04]
05  | [x][hs05] | [Desctructive chemistry text processing][aoc05]
Σ   |         5 |

Other solutions

I enjoy looking at how other coders solved the riddles to learn even more. This
year I follow (A-Z):
