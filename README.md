Advent of Code 2015
===================

**Spoiler Warning:** If you want to solve the challenges by yourself, don't read the code.

This repository contains the code I used to solve the challenges from http://adventofcode.com/

I used Haskell for most of the riddles. Sometimes I conceived a Ruby solution,
if there was a neat application for regexes or OOP. For algorithms which profit
from random access or are just easily faster imperatively, I used C.

The following table lists the available solutions by day and language. I also
added a short summary for each day. I marked the solutions which I consider
especially valuable or pretty with a star (☆).
