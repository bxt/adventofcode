Advent of Code 2024
===================

**Spoiler Warning:** If you want to solve the challenges by yourself, don't read the code.

This directory contains the code I used to solve the challenges from [Advent of Code 2024](http://adventofcode.com/2024).

This year I'm going with Deno, as version 2.0 just came out, and I'm very comfortable with TypeScript at this point. Actually, I'm focusing on learning to crate music, so I don't participate as intensively this year.

Other solutions
---------------

I enjoy looking at how other coders solved the riddles to learn even more. This
year I follow (A-Z):
