Advent of Code 2019
===================

**Spoiler Warning:** If you want to solve the challenges by yourself, don't read the code.

This directory contains the code I used to solve the challenges from [Advent of Code 2019](http://adventofcode.com/2019).

This year I'm going with `go`. Solutions can be run with `go run main.go`.

Contents
--------

The following table lists the available solutions by day and language. I also
added a short summary for each day. I marked the solutions which I consider
especially valuable or pretty with a star (â˜†).

Day | Go lang   | Description
----|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------
01  | [x][go01] | [Being clever with modulus or just summing][aoc01]
Î£   |         1 |

Other solutions

I enjoy looking at how other coders solved the riddles to learn even more. This
year I follow (A-Z):
