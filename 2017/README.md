Advent of Code 2017
===================

**Spoiler Warning:** If you want to solve the challenges by yourself, don't read the code.

This directory contains the code I used to solve the challenges from [Advent of Code 2017](http://adventofcode.com/2017).

The following table lists the available solutions by day and language. I also
added a short summary for each day. I marked the solutions which I consider
especially valuable or pretty with a star (☆).

Day | Scala     | Rust      | Description                             
----|-----------|-----------|-----------------------------------------
01  | [x][sc01] |           | [Sum equal digits][aoc01]
02  | [x][sc02] |           | [Sum spreadsheet min/max][aoc02]
Σ   |         2 |         0 |

Other solutions
---------------

I enjoy looking at how other coders solved the riddles to learn even more. This
year I follow (A-Z):

* [cschell](https://github.com/cschell/adventofcode/tree/master/2017) (Python, Ruby, Rust)
* [glguy](https://github.com/glguy/advent2017) (Haskell)
* [msullivan](https://github.com/msullivan/advent-of-code/tree/master/2017) (Haskell, Python)

These coders form last year didn't yet push anything this year, but I'll keep an eye open (A-Z):

* [bildzeitung](https://github.com/bildzeitung/) (Python?)
* [fdlk](https://github.com/fdlk/) (Scala?)
* [Pyrobolser](https://github.com/Pyrobolser/) (C#)
