Advent of Code 20202
===================

**Spoiler Warning:** If you want to solve the challenges by yourself, don't read the code.

This directory contains the code I used to solve the challenges from [Advent of Code 2020](http://adventofcode.com/2020).

This year I'm going with TypeScript using [`deno`](https://deno.land/). Solutions can be run with `./main.ts`.

Contents
--------

The following table lists the available solutions by day and language. I also
added a short summary for each day. I marked the solutions which I consider
especially valuable or pretty with a star (â˜†).

Day | Deno         | Description
----|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------
01  | [x][deno01] | [Combining, finding, summing, multiplying][aoc01]
Î£   |           1 |

Other solutions

I enjoy looking at how other coders solved the riddles to learn even more. This
year I follow (A-Z):
